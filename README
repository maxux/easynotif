A simple notifications console to keep track of your notifications with last-read
notification.

To use it, just compile the code:
$ make

Make a fifo somewhere:
$ mkfifo /tmp/notifications

Start the easynotif with fifo as argument:
$ ./easynotif /tmp/notifications

Try it:
$ echo "Hello World" > /tmp/notifications

Enjoy.

You can use this code on a screen/tmux and get your notifications everywhere !
